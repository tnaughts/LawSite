Any individual who negligently operates a motor vehicle may be required to pay damages to an injured victim. A personal injury case involving a vehicle accident may become formalized through civil court proceedings or may be resolved through an informal settlement before a lawsuit is filed. Vehicle accidents can include:\n\nAdmiralty and maritime law\nATV accidents\nAutomobile accidents: A car accident is a collision involving an automobile and anything that causes damage to the automobile, including other automobiles, telephone poles, buildings and trees. Sometimes a car accident may also refer to an automobile striking a human or animal. Car accidents — also called traffic collisions, auto accidents, road accidents, personal injury collisions, motor vehicle accidents and crashes — kill an estimated 1.2 million people worldwide each year, and injure about forty times this number.\nAviation accidents\nBicycle accidents: According to the Federal Highway Administration, over 67,000 cyclists in the U.S. are injured every year in accidents involving motor vehicles.  Many cyclists who are injured in bicycle accidents are unaware that they have a personal injury case and that they may be entitled to compensation for injuries, pain and suffering, medical bills and lost incomes.  A cyclist may be entitled to receive compensation for an injury sustained because of a pothole, poor road or defective sidewalk.  There are state mandated residential and commercial bicycle laws, which entitle cyclists to observe different traffic rules than cars, trucks and other motorized vehicles.  This may mean that the cyclist is not legally responsible for an accident.\nBoating accidents\nCommercial bus accidents\nCruise ship accidents\nIntersection accidents\nMotorcycle accidents: Motorcycle riders are often exposed to dangers not met by automobile drivers and other motorists on the road. The lack on any substantial protective barriers, as well as the difficulty that other motorists may have in seeing or stopping for a motorcycle, leaves riders prone to serious personal injury in the event of an accident.\nPedestrian accidents\nRear end collisions\nSemi-tractor trailer accidents\nSchool bus accidents\nSUV rollover accidents: Although SUV rollovers do not occur as often as other automobile accidents, when they do occur they have a higher chance of resulting in serious injury or death, and are considered to be the most fatal type of vehicle accident on national roadways. According to the Federal Highway Administration, SUV rollover accidents account for more than side and rear fatal vehicles combined and SUV's are three times more likely than the average passenger car rollover.\n\nAlthough SUV's were designed primarily for the purpose of off-roading, manufacturers have since discovered their immense popularity as family vehicles. Manufacturers have begun removing roll bars in current models. SUV seat structures are not designed to keep occupants in place during a rollover regardless if seatbelts are worn. Vehicle roofs, windshields and side windows easily collapse, increasing the risk of occupant head, brain and spinal cord and back injuries. While the body of an SUV remains the same as it would if used for off-roading, the removal of the roll bars, combined with the high center gravity due to multiple passengers, make rollover accidents and occupant ejection that much more fatal.\nTrain accidents: Train accidents can result in injuries such as sprains and fractures, catastrophic injury such as head trauma, brain damage, paralysis and loss of lives or property. Train accidents can include derailments, collisions with passenger vehicles or other trains, grade crossing accidents or accidents due to mechanical failure. It is the railroad company's responsibility to ensure that there are appropriate signals and gates at every railroad crossing for safety precautions. If the railroad company fails to take such precautions, they are liable for any injury or death that ensues. Victims of train accidents may be entitled to compensation for pain and suffering, medical expenses, property damage, lost wages and loss of earning capacity.\nTruck accidents\nYacht accidents\nThe surviving family members of a fatally injured accident victim may be able to bring wrongful death charges against the defendant."], ["created_at", "2016-11-15 17:30:56.215942"], ["updated_at", "2016-11-15 17:30:56.215942"]]

Any individual who negligently operates a motor vehicle may be required to pay damages to an injured victim.  A personal injury case involving a vehicle accident may become formalized through civil court proceedings or may be resolved through an informal settlement before a lawsuit is filed.  Vehicle accidents can include:\n</p>\n\n<p><ul>\n\t<li><b>Admiralty and maritime law</b></li>\n\t<li><b>ATV accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Automobile accidents:</b> A car accident is a collision involving an automobile and anything that causes damage to the automobile, including other automobiles, telephone poles, buildings and trees. Sometimes a car accident may also refer to an automobile striking a human or animal. Car accidents — also called traffic collisions, auto accidents, road accidents, personal injury collisions, motor vehicle accidents and crashes — kill an estimated 1.2 million people worldwide each year, and injure about forty times this number.\n</li>\n    <li><b>Aviation accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Bicycle accidents:</b> According to the Federal Highway Administration, over 67,000 cyclists in the U.S. are injured every year in accidents involving motor vehicles.  Many cyclists who are injured in bicycle accidents are unaware that they have a personal injury case and that they may be entitled to compensation for injuries, pain and suffering, medical bills and lost incomes.  A cyclist may be entitled to receive compensation for an injury sustained because of a pothole, poor road or defective sidewalk.  There are state mandated residential and commercial bicycle laws, which entitle cyclists to observe different traffic rules than cars, trucks and other motorized vehicles.  This may mean that the cyclist is not legally responsible for an accident. </li>\n    <li><b>Boating accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Commercial bus accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Cruise ship accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Intersection accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Motorcycle accidents:</b> Motorcycle riders are often exposed to dangers not met by automobile drivers and other motorists on the road.  The lack on any substantial protective barriers, as well as the difficulty that other motorists may have in seeing or stopping for a motorcycle, leaves riders prone to serious personal injury in the event of an accident.</li>\n    <li><b>Pedestrian accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Rear end collisions</b></li>\n    <li><b>Semi-tractor trailer accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>School bus accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>SUV rollover accidents:</b> Although SUV rollovers do not occur as often as other automobile accidents, when they do occur they have a higher chance of resulting in serious injury or death, and are considered to be the most fatal type of vehicle accident on national roadways.  According to the Federal Highway Administration, SUV rollover accidents account for more than side and rear fatal vehicles combined and SUV's are three times more likely than the average passenger car rollover.<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although SUV's were designed primarily for the purpose of off-roading, manufacturers have since discovered their immense popularity as family vehicles.  Manufacturers have begun removing roll bars in current models.  SUV seat structures are not designed to keep occupants in place during a rollover regardless if seatbelts are worn.  Vehicle roofs, windshields and side windows easily collapse, increasing the risk of occupant head, brain and spinal cord and back injuries.  While the body of an SUV remains the same as it would if used for off-roading, the removal of the roll bars, combined with the high center gravity due to multiple passengers, make rollover accidents and occupant ejection that much more fatal.</li>\n\n    <li><b>Train accidents: </b>Train accidents can result in injuries such as sprains and fractures, catastrophic injury such as head trauma, brain damage, paralysis and loss of lives or property.  Train accidents can include derailments, collisions with passenger vehicles or other trains, grade crossing accidents or accidents due to mechanical failure.  It is the railroad company's responsibility to ensure that there are appropriate signals and gates at every railroad crossing for safety precautions.  If the railroad company fails to take such precautions, they are liable for any injury or death that ensues.  Victims of train accidents may be entitled to compensation for pain and suffering, medical expenses, property damage, lost wages and loss of earning capacity.</li>\n    <li><b>Truck accidents</b></li>\n    <li><b>Yacht accidents</b></li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>The surviving family members of a fatally injured accident victim may be able to bring wrongful death charges against the defendant.</p>"], ["created_at", "2016-11-15 19:46:31.172224"], ["updated_at", "2016-11-15 19:46:31.172224"]]
